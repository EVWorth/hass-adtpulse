## RECOMMENDED REPLACEMENT

Install [HomeBridge](https://homebridge.io/) on a separate host from Home Assistant and install
the [ADT Pulse Plug-In](https://github.com/mrjackyliang/homebridge-adt-pulse). 

ADT sensors and alarm panel integration works perfect with Home Assistant's native HomeKit integration, including fast sensor status updates.
